        <p>
            My name is Théo Dumont, I am 19 years old and I am currently in the second year of BTS SIO<br>
            at Dijon. My goal is to have enough knowledge to work and invest myself as a software<br>
            developer. Since I was 12, IT has played an important role in my life. But what<br>
            interested me most at the time was being a video game developer. But as my knowledge<br>
            grew in the field of development computer science thanks to python, I have strayed<br>
            further and further from my initial objective. I decided to do this BTS to have<br>
            more practical exercises than theoretical and to discover new languages that<br>
            allow me to further open my horizons.
